# how to setup the project?
- clone the project
- open cmd inside the WorkingImplementationOfMockito folder
- run the below command
  ``` mvn clean install ```
- you are good to go :)

# how to use the project?
- it is advised to understand the code while reading the [JavaTpoint's Mockito Tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/mockito)
- start from src/main/java/PojoClasses -> these classes are the one's that we will be mocking and testing.
- then look into src/test/java/TestingWithoutMockito to understand the limitations without mockito.
- then move to src/test/java/TestingWithMockito to understand the benefits of Mockito as well as get hands on with code implementations
- lastly move to src/test/java/MockitoWithAnnotations to understand how to use annotations in Mockito

# Next Update:
- A Very Brief and concise documentations covering all important points regarding mockito will be made available.

- don't forget to star and share the project :)
